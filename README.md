# AES
AES-128bits encryption program code with a classic block cipher mode of operation. 


The program allows encryption/decryption of a text (converted using the ascii table) given using a 128-bit key. 

Planned :
- Encryption/decryption for a key of 192/256bits.
- Choice between ascii and utf-8
- Different block cipher mode of operation
